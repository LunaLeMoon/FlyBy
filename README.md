# FlyBy
This script is supposed to be a server event. A plane flies across the map, then it de-spawns.
In-game, you can use the /flyby command to trigger the flyby event. The plane will spawn at the specified coordinates, the pilot will fly the plane to the destination coordinates while maintaining its altitude, and both the plane and the pilot will be cleaned up when the plane reaches the destination.

Make sure to adjust the configuration variables at the beginning of the script (planeModel, spawnCoords, destinationCoords, and doorOpen) to match your desired settings.
